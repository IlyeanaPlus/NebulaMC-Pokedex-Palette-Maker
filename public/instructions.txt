I'm very tired and words should go here but I need a nap, I'll do it later

This is a tool for people who:
- can code but can't art
- can art but can't code

With the ability to create custom pokedexes for custom palettes or forms,
we need to be able to make good colour choices for the UI for each dex. This helps
us collaborate! 

You can 'Sync' colours to the Primary and just mess around with that, as it follows
the same 'rules' as the pixelmon palettes (Mega, Shiny, Etc) by picking one colour 
and adjusting the lightness and saturation to get the secondary 

-OR- you can unsync and play with values manually!
